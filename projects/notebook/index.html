<p><img src="/projects/notebook/icon512.png" alt="drawing" style="width:10%;"/>My Vocabulary Notebook is a notebook tool that you could build your own word list and help you learning the language.</p>
<p>


</p>


<p>
    When you encounter a new word, you could search it with the help of the embedded dictionary. Usually you will get several meanings. Then you can choose to add this word and its meaning into your word list.
    


</p>
<p>
    As your word list accumulated, you will need to edit it. Editing of the word list is totally supported. You could edit its meaning or just delete it if itâ€™s not important for you anymore.
</p>
<p>Keep using this APP and your vocabulary will surely improve!ðŸŒ¹</p>
