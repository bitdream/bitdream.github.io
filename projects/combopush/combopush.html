<p></p>Push, combine as squares, clean and combo！</p>
<p>


</p>


<p>
    Combo Push is an innovative Tetromino block match game. 
    The key rule is to push the blocks and combine them to form a square.
    The special challenges compared with the traditional one includes:
    
    
    
    🤞:<br/>
<ul>
<li>
🍕1 Clear occurs when a minimum 3x3 square was filled rather than a line was filled.
</li>
<li>
🍔2 Blocks come from 4 directions rather than always from top.
</li>
<li>
🍟3 Puzzle mode only allows one time clear for all existing blocks.
</li>
<li>
🍿4 Different levels of combos.
</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
The levels are mixed with different game modes, so explore the game and find more🌹!
