# Crossword Terminology
A few terms are good to know when discussing crosswords. I’ll start with the absolute
basics, in case you’re not familiar with crosswords at all.

A crossword puzzle consists of a grid of black and white squares, some of which are
numbered, and a set of clues placed near the grid. Crossword grids are usually an odd
number of squares across and down — common grid sizes are 13 x 13 and 15 x 15.

Tiny clue numbers are placed in the corners of some of the squares, at the locations
where a word starts. Once you’ve solved a clue, you write the answer into the grid,
starting the word at the corresponding number on the grid. Answers can be entered
either horizontally, called across entries, or vertically, called down entries.

So, for example, the answer to clue ‘8 across’ is written into the grid, with the first letter
going in at the white square with the tiny ‘8’ in the corner, and the letters following
subsequently across the grid. The clue numbers aren’t used for anything else; they
simply connect the clue and its answer to the correct position in the grid.

Starting at the corresponding clue number, as with across clues, down clues are written
into the grid, from top to bottom.
The white squares of a grid are generally called just that — the white squares. The black
squares can be called the darks, blanks, blocks or simply the black squares. In this book, I
use the term black squares.
A white square that’s part of both an across and a down word is said to be checked,
keyed or crossed. A white square that’s part of just one word is unchecked, unkeyed or
uncrossed (makes a crazy sort of sense!). In this book, I use the terms checked and
unchecked.
The next figure shows the basic elements of a crossword grid.

> Some differences exist between the crossword styles popular in different
countries. For example, American crossword grids are fully checked, with every white
square in the grid being crossed by both an across and a down word. British grids have
many more unchecked letters. 

The clues for a crossword are usually printed in two columns, one for the across clues
and one for the down clues. In cryptics (and many British-style quick, non-cryptic
crosswords), the letter count is in brackets at the end of the clue, which tells you how
many letters are in the answer. Of course, you can discover this information for yourself
by counting the relevant squares in the grid. However, the letter count also tells you
whether a hyphen is present in the answer, or the answer’s more than one word, which
can be very helpful information. These quick clues illustrate these uses of the letter
count:
>Radiator additive (4-6) = ANTI-FREEZE
Decorative legume (5,3) = SWEET PEA
