The game uses Google Play Game Services to manage the account and game data. Usually it doesn't create an account unless it is your first game with the Google Play Game Services. Anyway instructions are provided here.
Here are the steps you can delete your account and data.

**Delete your Play Games profile and data**
You can delete Play Games data from your Google account for one or all games you’ve played. If you delete data for a game, you might also delete any in-game achievements or progress, depending on how the developer has built the game.
