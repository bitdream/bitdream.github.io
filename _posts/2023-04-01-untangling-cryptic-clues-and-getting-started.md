# Dissecting Cryptic Clues

Each cryptic clue is basically a very concise mini-puzzle.
A cryptic clue contains a definition and a bit of
wordplay. Yes, you heard right. Cryptic clues contain the
definition of the answer, in plain sight, such as you’d
find in any quick, non-cryptic, crossword clue. However,
cryptic clues also include other elements to point you in
the right direction of the answer.

## Finding the definition within the clue

The definition may be disguised somewhat, but, trust me,
it’s there! It resides at the start or end of the clue
(not in the middle). A major key to cracking cryptics is
to locate the definition within each clue.

 The definition part of a cryptic clue may not be an

exact dictionary synonym for the answer — it may be
off at a slight tangent to it. It does have to be a
fair definition, though, and has to match the part of
speech of the answer (so a plural answer has to have a
plural definition, for example).

The definition part of the clue may be a straight synonym
for the answer, or it may require a bit more of a stretch
of the imagination, such as they would be good for picnics
= SANDWICHES, which clearly isn’t a dictionary definition
for sandwiches.

Sometimes a definition in a clue presents you with an
example of something, and you need to extrapolate the
definition from this example. These clues often have
perhaps, or similar in the clue wording.

So be prepared to look a little further afield for
meanings or synonyms for the definition in the clue,
because the answer may not be the most obvious word that
comes to mind.

The definition part of the clue may also suggest, say, a
noun on the surface reading, but in fact be defining a
verb.

## Having fun with wordplay

The wordplay part of the clue is (hopefully!) where the
enjoyment comes in.

Solving the wordplay side of the clue should give you the
same answer provided by the definition part of the clue.
This means you get confirmation right away that you’ve
got the right answer — something I love about cryptic
clues. The wordplay and the definition should both lead to
the same answer, and then you get that oh so satisfying
‘Ah haaa!’ moment.

Because each cryptic clue contains the definition
and a bit of wordplay, once you’ve figured out which
part of the clue is the wordplay element, the
remainder of the clue can automatically be pinned down
as the definition.

Roughly eight main types of wordplay devices are used in
cryptic clues:

Anagrams

Charades, or linked words

Containers, or words inside other words

Homophones, or words that sound like other words

Reversals

Deletions

Double definitions

Hidden words


## Looking out for indicator words

Along with the definition and some wordplay, many cryptic
clues also include indicator words. These vital words
indicate the sort of wordplay device involved.

For example, anagram indicators are words included in the
clue like cooked, damaged, insane and mixed up — words
that indicate you need to alter the letter order of some
of the words in the clue to get the answer.

While indicator words often highlight the existence

of a wordplay device in a clue, they may also be a
perfectly ‘innocent’ part of a totally different
type of clue, such as the definition. Remember to
think of all possibilities when working on clues!

## Getting a handle on linking words and punctuation

Even the small words and punctuation used in cryptic clues
can be important — or an attempt to slow you down!

Cryptic clues may have linking words in them, which help
the clue to read well, and connect the definition and the
wordplay to each other. These are generally short words
and phrases such as a, and, can be, from, gets, has, in,
is, reveals, with and yielding (among many others). Not
all clues have them, however, so depending on whose
crosswords you’re solving, you may come across these a
lot, or not often at all.

Linking words usually give a sense of equality (this
equals that), or show that one part of the clue results in
the other. Keep in mind, though, that a word that looks
like a linking word might be another part of the clue,
such as part of the definition, or anagram fodder.

Another thing to be aware of is punctuation in clues —
it’s generally there to confuse you, and make the
superficial meaning read better. In general, it’s safe to
ignore it. A question mark can sometimes indicate a need
to think a bit more laterally. An apostrophe s (’s) is
often an abbreviation of is.

## Appreciating abbreviations

Abbreviations are widely used in cryptic clues, to add one
or a few letters to the wordplay. Thousands of words can
be used as ‘abbreviation indicators’. Most of these are
abbreviations you are familiar with, such as right = R and
east = E. However, many are more unusual. For example,
first = IST, because it looks a bit like 1st. 


# Putting it All Together

Launching into a real cryptic clue can help you get a feel
for the different elements within the clue. Take, for
example, the following:
Knave’s wild dog is missing Al (4)

On first reading, I’m trying to make you imagine a
villain’s wild dog pining for his mate, Al. This is the
surface meaning — try to ignore this imagery!
In this case, the definition is Knave, and the wordplay is
wild dog is missing Al. The clue should be read as, ‘A
wild dog without Al also means knave.’ Can you see the
answer? Yes, it’s JACK (JACKAL without AL).

# Planning Your Attack

Here are my tips for making a start on any crossword:

Don’t try to do the clues in order. Any answer you can
put into the grid makes it easier for you to solve the
words that cross over.

Draw a hyphen or bar on the grid when a clue’s letter
count shows the answer is hyphenated or more than one
word.

Check out the letter count, looking for shorter or very
long words. Shorter words can be the easier words to
guess, but so too can long words as they have fewer
possible solutions.

Look for clues where the answer looks like it may be a
plural and pencil in an S at the end of these clues.

If an answer you’re pencilling in to the grid results
in an unlikely letter pattern in the crossing-over
word, sorry to say, but your answer may be wrong.

If you’re very stuck on a clue, leave it for a while.
Often the answer suddenly seems completely obvious,
after a break!

 Here’s a list of tips specifically for solving

cryptic crosswords:

The definition of the answer is in the clue, either at
the start or end of the clue.

If you think you know what the answer may be (just from
the definition), see if you can work backwards from it
to figure out whether the wordplay section of the clue
fits your answer.

Look at each word in the clue one by one, rather than
together as a sentence. Don’t ignore a single word!
Many words indicate abbreviations, and lead to one or
two letters (such as north = N).

It’s generally safe to ignore most punctuation and all
capital letters in clues.

The definition has to match the part of speech and
tense of the answer.

Use a thesaurus to look for synonyms for words near the
start or end of a clue.

Practise and practise and practise. This is a difficult
puzzle genre, it takes time to improve.

# Touching on Cryptic Devices

There isn’t room here to go into the workings of each
cryptic device in detail (see Solving Cryptic Crosswords
For Dummies for in-depth explanations and practice
crosswords). However, I have put together this little list
to help you remember the basics of each clue type, and
what sort of words are used as indicators for each device.

## Anagrams

The letters to be jumbled up (the fodder) are in plain
view in the clue. Abbreviations can be included in the
fodder. Indicators give a sense of being awkward, broken,
confused, jumbled, mad, mixed, rebuilt, sick and so on.
The longest words in a grid often have anagram clues.

## Charades

One part comes after another in order, adding up to give
the answer and abbreviations are often used.

Indicator words are not generally found in these clues;
when used, they give a sense of things being added on, or
coming one after the other. This is a very common clue
device, and it is often used in conjunction with other
devices.

## Containers

This is another very common cryptic device, and can be
used in combination with other devices. One word, or set
of letters, is put inside another word or set of letters.

Indicator words give a sense of insertion or containment,
or of being put inside or within something else.

## Homophones

Homophones are a less common cryptic device, and a
crossword may have none, or just one or two.

The answer sounds the same as a different word, but they
are spelt differently and mean different things.
Indicators include words that give a sense of things being
spoken, broadcast, noisy, or listened to.

## Reversals

A whole word, or a set of letters, is reversed to form
another word, or part of a word in these clue types.
Indicators of reversals are words that give a sense of
things being reversed, backwards, sent back, and so on.
This is a common cryptic device, and often used in
conjunction with other devices.

## Deletions

With this device, letters are deleted from words to get to
the answer. Indicators are words that give a sense of
something being cut off, lost, removed, and so on. Letter
position can also be indicated with words such as head,
finally, middle, borders, half, and so on.

This is a very common device, and is often used in
conjunction with other cryptic devices.

Substitutions are a rarer form of deletions, where one
letter is substituted for another. Indicator words such as
for, instead of, replacing, and so on are used.

## Double definitions

These clue devices present two definitions for the same
word, one after the other. No other wordplay is used, and
they can be very short.

Double definition clues don’t usually have indicator
words, apart from a few words like and, but, for, gives,
makes, or, and that.

## Hidden words

This is a less common clue device. Hidden word clues have
the answers within the clue, in plain view. The answer is
hidden amongst the letters of words in the clue. Sometimes
the words are hidden as alternating letters. Indicator
words give a sense of containment.

## Abbreviations

Abbreviations are widely used in all cryptic crosswords.
Many words in cryptic clues lead to abbreviations of one
or a few letters. Looking up single letter entries in a
dictionary will reveal many of them. Learning the commonly
used cryptic abbreviations will help your skill in solving
cryptics enormously.
